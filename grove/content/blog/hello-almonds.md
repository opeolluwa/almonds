## Why we built Almonds

Productivity tools have become fragmented. You have one app for notes, another for bookmarks, another for code snippets — and a monthly bill for each.

Almonds was born out of a simple idea: what if everything lived in one place, ran locally on your machine, and was completely free?

## What's inside

Almonds ships with everything you need to stay focused:

- **Notes** — rich markdown editing, offline first
- **Bookmarks** — save and tag links without the clutter
- **Snippets** — your personal code library
- **Todo** — lightweight task tracking
- **Moodboard** — visual inspiration board
- **Scratch Pad** — a blank canvas for quick thoughts
- **AI** — local inference via Ollama, no API keys required

## Open source, MIT licensed

Every line of code is public. Fork it, self-host it, contribute to it. We believe great tools should be accessible to everyone.
